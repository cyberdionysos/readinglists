* Crews, F. *The Memory Wars*. (It is good to get some of the fiercest, most pugnacious criticisms of Freud and of repressed memory, but it is questionable to me how much the dangerous and theoretically poor "repressed memory" and somatic traumatic memory ideas actually have to do with Freud and the European psychoanalytical tradition so much as American practitioners vaguely inspired by Freud).
